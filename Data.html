<h2>FS-3 Challenge Data</h2>

 						<p style="font-size: 14px;text-align: center;">Figure shows the Stages of the Mission</p><br>
  						<p>The Stages 1, 5 and 6 were high impact mission-critical events which is ideal for the development of the 100-hour Challenge Corpus. With the quality of speech data varying between  0 and 20 dB SNR in this challenge corpus, the channel variability and complex interactions across all five channels of interest are mostly encapsulated in these 100 hours. The multichannel data are chosen from the major events given below:</p>
  						<ul>
  								<li> Lift Off (25 hours)</li><br>
								<li> Lunar Landing (50 hours)</li><br>
								<li> Lunar Walking (25 hours)</li><br>
						</ul>
						<p>These landmark events have been found to possess rich information from the speech and language perspective.five channels out of the 29 channels were picked since it had the the most activity over the selected events. </p>
						<ul>
  								<li> Flight Director (FD) </li><br>
								<li> Mission Operations Control Room (MOCR)</li><br>
								<li> Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC)</li><br>
								<li> Network Controller (NTWK) </li><br>
								<li> Electrical, Environmental and Consumables Manager (EECOM) </li><br>
						</ul>
						<p>The personnel operating these five channels (channel owners/primary speakers) were in command of the most critical aspects of the mission, with additional backroom staff looping in for interactions with the primary owners of this channel.</p><br>
						<img src="images/DT1.png" alt="Table 1 the shows distribution of total speech content" id="fsc"><br>
						<p>The distribution of total speech content in each of the channels for every event has been given in the table above. Total speech content in the challenge corpus amounts to approximately 36 hours.</p>
<p>To make sure there is an equitable distribution of data into training, evaluation, and development sets for the challenge tasks, we have categorized the data based on noise levels, amount of speech content, and amount of silence. Due to the long silence durations, and based on importance of the mission, the speech activity density of the corpus varies throughout the mission.</p>
						<img src="images/DT2.png" alt="Table 2 shows the Signal to Noise Ratio Statistics per channel for Dev Data" id="fsc"><br>
						<p>The above table above is a general analysis of the Challenge data. Even though the Researchers are not provided with the channel information of Train, Test and Dev Sets, they may be able to make inferences by computing SNRâ€™s for each file.</p>
